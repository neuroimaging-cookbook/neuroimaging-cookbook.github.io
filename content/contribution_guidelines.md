# Contributing to the Neuroimaging Cookbook

Welcome to the Neuroimaging Cookbook repository! In this project, contributions from the community are highly welcome. This guideline will give you all the necessary instructions to contribute to the Neuroimaging Cookbook, whether you are new to the whole workflow or not. 
 
Please do not forget, you are welcome to contribute to the development of the BNeuroimaging Cookbook no matter your skill level or experiences. There is no single way of contributing to open science projects. Everyone from every level of skill and experience can make a huge impact on the development of the Neuroimaging Cookbook. And there is no “being ready-enough” to start contributing to an open science project. You might start contributing inside of your comfort zone, and with time, switch over the other parts. Contributing to an open science project is one of the most efficient ways of learning and improving your skill sets because it is a safe environment in which to make mistakes and engage with a collaborative community.

As in many open science projects, you can contribute in many ways. You can write community documents and guidelines, test the code, collect case studies, provide feedback, address issues, or start coding small bits and pieces. All of these contributions are equally important. Therefore, please do not hesitate to offer your contributions! Open science tools can only grow with community support,  so any single intention of help is extremely appreciated.

## [Joining the Neuroimaging Cookbook Project](#joining_neuroimaging_cookbook_project)
[Neuroimaging Cookbook Project](https://github.com/neuroimaging-cookbook/neuroimaging-cookbook.github.io) is a community project, aims to centralize code snippets from different software languages to help the community with runing/initializing their neuroimaging analysis and provide them an easier and fluid experiences in adopting open science practices in coding that serves to the same analysis purposes.

The best way to start contributing to an open science community and project is to actively engage with the community resources and platforms and contributing to the ongoing projects as much as you can contribute. To start your contributions to Neuroimaging Cookbook, you might begin with reviewing and working on the currently listed [issues](https://github.com/neuroimaging-cookbook/neuroimaging-cookbook.github.io/issues)in the Neuroimaging Cookbook repository and get involved in discussions run on the [Neuroimagign Cookbook communication channels](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/neuroimaging-cookbook). Before you start,   please make sure that you read our [Code of Conduct]( ) which aims to assure creating equal, safe, and fair opportunities for every single contributor to the project.
 
## [Code of Conduct](#code_of_conduct)
If you decide to contribute to the app’s development, we ask that you and all of our contributors read and adhere to our [Code of Conduct]()

The [Code of Conduct]() aims to provide accessible, inclusive, diverse, and safe community environments so that every single contributor is equitably valued. We must ensure respect and safety to move the community forward. Therefore, we want to emphasize that all contributors and users must accept and follow our Code of Conduct. Please go through the Code of Conduct and make sure you follow each of the listed acts.

## [Reach Us](#reach_us)
There are lots of ways to get in touch with the team maintaining Neuroimaging Cookbook.

- Our communication channel in the [Neuroimaging Cookbook Mattermost Team](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/neuroimaging-cookbook)
This is our preferred way to answer questions so that others who have similar questions can benefit too! Even if your question is not well-defined, just post what you have so far and we will be able to point you in the right direction.


- The Github Issues 
[Neuroimaging Cookbook Issues](https://github.com/neuroimaging-cookbook/neuroimaging-cookbook.github.io/issues)


## [Contributing through GitHub](#contributing_through_github)
Before you start, you'll need to set up a free [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and sign in. Here are some [instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account). 

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a version control tool, widely used by the open-source science community, which allows contributors to track changes and sync work with the master (main) repository. [GitHub](https://github.com/) sits on top of git and supports collaborative and distributed working.

If you're not yet familiar with git, there are lots of great resources to help you git started! Some of our favourites include the [git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) and the [Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) [introduction to git](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/). Also, our community is here to help you as necessary. Please do not hesitate to reach out with questions and requests for the support! We are here to help! ❤️
 
## Writing in markdown
GitHub has a helpful page on [getting started with writing and formatting on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github). Most of the writing that you'll do will be in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown). You can think of Markdown as a few little symbols around your text that will allow GitHub to recognize and format the text. For example, you could write words as bold (`**bold**`)`, or in italics (``*italics*`), or as a link (`[link](https://https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)`) to another webpage.	


## [Where to start: wiki, code, and templates](#where_to_start)


### Wiki (link)
The easiest place to find information about. Review the wiki to better understand Neuroimaging Cookbook, use cases, and areas of improvement. 

### Code (link)
Although the repository is under development, we hope that users and contributors can find and share small pieces of code that are useful for getting started with the app. To contribute to the codebase you'll need to submit a pull request. Check out our pull request guidelines below.
 
### Issues
Every project on GitHub uses a set of issues to publicly list and discuss standing problems and/or missing features in the current project and allows continuing discussions over public channels. Anyone with a Github account can contribute to these discussions and take a role in decisions. Issues cover many different aspects of the project. For instance, an issue might discuss the maintenance of a piece of code or a document,  it might introduce a new feature or update to bring to the project, or it might ask for help in addressing a problem with the project. Each of these issues has a set of goals and a timeline to move the project forward. By using issues, contributors can easily keep track of and address standing problems and see the assigned contributors and the urgency of the issue at hand. 
 
Issues should be simple, short, and require one single task. Although it can be tempting to create a giant issue that requires many steps, splitting issues into smaller pieces increases readability and allows contributors from all possible backgrounds to participate. Smaller issues also promote fair division labour among contributors as well as make auditing and tracing the issue’s progress easier. 

We use labels on our issues, which indicate how each issue relates to the overall project's goals and immediate next steps.
 
### Issue Labels
The current list of issue labels are here and include:
[Neuroimaging Cookbook Issues](htps://github.com/neuroimaging-cookbook/neuroimaging-cookbook.github.io/issues)


**good first issue** These issues contain tasks that are accessible to new contributors because they do not require advanced skills or a steep learning curve. If you're not sure about how to go about contributing, these are good places to start. You'll be mentored through the contribution process by the maintenance team. If you're a seasoned contributor, please select a different issue to work on and keep these available for the newer and potentially more anxious team members. If you feel that you can contribute to one of these issues, we especially encourage you to do so! 
 
**bug** These issues point to problems in the project. If you find a new bug, please give as much detail as possible in your issue, including steps to recreate the error. If you experience the same bug as one already listed, please add any additional information that you have as a comment.
 
**feature** These issues introduce new features and improvements for consideration. Please try to make sure that your requested feature is distinct from any others that have already been requested or implemented. If you find one that's similar but there are subtle differences, please reference the other request in your issue.
 
**enhancement** These issues suggest new updates and amendments regarding an existing feature of the project. If you think there is a need for an enhancement in an existing feature due to the difficulties it creates in the current form, please give as much detail as possible about those difficulties. In addition, provide suggestions about potential methods/approaches to resolving those difficulties and the possible workload associated with the enhancement. 
 
**question** It indicates that an issue or pull request needs more information. These issues ask questions about the project or point out areas that might need clarification and/or discussion. This label is usually used to resolve quick questions through contributor discussion in contrast to bigger issues that require resolving a bug or adding new features. Using this label will attract the contributors’ attention easily and will let them contribute to the discussions quickly. Similarly, if you see such a label on an issue, please do not hesitate to share your thoughts and suggestions. 
 
**help wanted** It indicates a new feature, request, or enhancement. This label can include any change or upgrade that increases the project capabilities, performance, or scalability. In general, enhancements include:

- Additional functionality
- Error/bug repair and handling
- Better code coverage
- Improved performance
 
**invalid** It indicates that an issue or pull request is no longer relevant.
 
**dependencies** It helps to track and resolve vulnerabilities for certain types of dependencies.
 
**wont fix** It indicates issues that are currently not viable to solve or out of the scope of the project
 
**documentation** These issues relate to improving or updating the documentation.
These are usually really great issues to help out with: the main goal of good documentation is to facilitate the contribution and use of the app without leaving any grey areas to the reader. Therefore any documents that would achieve this goal would be more than welcome!

**community** These issues relate to building and supporting the app’s community. 


Open science projects would not live without the support of the community. Any opportunity that would allow a contribution from the community should be listed as an issue and labelled with this particular label. 
 
## [Make a change with a pull request](#make_changes_pull_request)
We appreciate all contributions and pull requests to the Neuroimaging Cookbook from the community. **THANK YOU** for helping us build this useful resource. We recommend that you use this workflow when contributing to the Neuroimaging Cookbook:  
 
**1. First, comment on an existing issue or open a new issue.**
This allows other members of the BNeuroimaging Cookbook development team to confirm that you aren't overlapping with work that's already underway and that all contributors are operating with shared goals. [This blog](https://www.igvita.com/2011/12/19/dont-push-your-pull-requests) provides a nice explanation of why putting this work in upfront is so useful to everyone involved.

**2. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the related repository from the Neuroimaging Cookbook organization to your account**

[Neuroimaging Cookbook Repository](htps://github.com/neuroimaging-cookbook/neuroimaging-cookbook.github.io/)


Click on the ‘Fork’ button near the top of the page. This creates a copy of the code under your account on GitHub. For more details on how to fork a repository see this guide. This is now your own unique copy of the Neuroimaging Cookbook. Changes here won't affect anyone else's work, so it's a safe space to explore edits to the code!

Make sure to [keep your fork up to date](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork) with the master repository, otherwise, you can end up with lots of dreaded 
[merge conflicts](https://help.github.com/articles/about-merge-conflicts).
 
**3. [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository) your forked Neuroimaging Cookbook repository to your machine/computer.**
While you can edit files [directly on Github](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository), sometimes the changes you want to make will be complex and you will want to use a [text editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor) that you have installed on your local machine/computer. 
(One great text editor is [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)). In order to work on the code locally, you must clone your forked repository. 
To keep up with the changes in the Neuroimaging Cookbook, add the [Neuroimaging Cookbook](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork) as a remote to your locally cloned repository.

**Neuroimaging Cookbook Repository**

`git remote add upstream https://github.com/neuroimaging-cookbook/neuroimaging-cookbook.github.io/?`
 
 
Make sure to [keep your fork up to date](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) with the upstream repository.
For example, to update your master branch on your local cloned repository:

`git fetch upstream`
`git checkout master`
`git merge upstream/master`
 
**4. Install the development dependencies:**
 
**5. Synchronize your master branch with the upstream master branch:**
`$ git checkout master`
`$ git pull upstream master`
 
**6. Create a [new branch](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/) to develop and maintain your proposed code changes.** 
For example:
`git fetch upstream` # Always start with an updated upstream
`git checkout -b fix/bug-1222 upstream/master`

and start making changes. Always use a feature branch. It’s good practice to never work on the `main` branch!

Please consider using appropriate branch names as those listed below, and mind that some of them are special (e.g., doc/ and docs/):
- fix/<some-identifier>: for bug fixes
- enh/<feature-name>: for new features
- doc/<some-identifier>: for documentation improvements. 

You should name all your documentation branches with the prefix doc/ or docs/ as that will preempt triggering the full battery of continuous integration tests.
 
 
**7. Make the changes you've discussed**
Develop the feature on your feature branch on your computer, using Git to do the version control. When you’re done editing, add changed files using git add and then git commit:

`$ git add modified_files`
`$ git commit`

to record your changes in Git, then push the changes to your GitHub account with:

`$ git push -u origin my_feature`

Try to keep the changes focused. It is generally easier to review changes that address one feature or bug at a time. It can also be helpful to test your changes locally, using a [REQUIRES INPUT]()

Once you are satisfied with your local changes, [add/commit/push them](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line) to the branch on your forked repository. If you submit a large amount of work all in one go it will be much more work for whoever is reviewing your pull request. [Help them help you](https://media.giphy.com/media/uRb2p09vY8lEs/giphy.gif) 😉

If you feel tempted to "branch out" then please make a [new branch](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) and a [new issue](https://github.com/INCF/bids-starter-kit/issues) to go with it.
 
**8. Submit [a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request)**
Follow [these](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) instructions to create a pull request from your fork. This will send an email to the 
committers. A member of the development team will review your changes to confirm that they can be merged into the main codebase.

During a [review](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-request-reviews), the development team will probably ask a few questions to help clarify the work you've done. Keep an eye on your Github notifications and be prepared to join in that conversation.

You can update your [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) of the Neuroimaging Cookbook repositories and the pull request will automatically update with those changes. You don't need to submit a new pull request when you make a change in response to questions/concerns that come up during a review.

GitHub has a [nice introduction]https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow) to the pull request workflow, but please [get in touch](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/neuroimaging-cookbook) if you have any questions.

## Pull Request Checklist
Before a pull request (PR) can be merged, it needs to be approved by two core developers. Please prefix the title of your pull request with `[MRG]` if the contribution is complete and should be subjected to a detailed review. An incomplete contribution – where you expect to do more work before receiving a full review – should be prefixed `[WIP]` (to indicate a “work in progress”) and changed to `[MRG]` when it matures. WIPs may be useful to indicate you are working on something to avoid duplicated work, request a broad review of functionality or API, or seek collaborators. WIPs often benefit from the inclusion of a [task list](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments) in the PR description.

In order to ease the reviewing process, we recommend that your contribution complies with the following rules before marking a PR as `[MRG]`. The **bolded** ones are especially important:

1. **Give your pull request a helpful title** that summarises what your contribution does. This title will often become the commit message once merged so it should summarise your contribution for posterity. In some cases “Fix <ISSUE TITLE>” is enough. “Fix #<ISSUE NUMBER>” is never a good title.

2. **Make sure your code is properly commented and documented**, and **make sure the documentation renders properly**. 

3.**Tests are necessary for enhancements to be accepted**. Bug-fixes or new features should be provided with [non-regression tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-regression_testing). These tests verify the correct behaviour of the fix or feature. In this manner, further modifications on the codebase are granted to be consistent with the desired behaviour. In the case of bug fixes, at the time of the PR, the non-regression tests should fail for the codebase in the master branch and pass for the PR code.

4. **Make sure that your PR does not add PEP8 violations**. To check the code that you changed, you can run the following command (see [above](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/contributing.html#upstream) set up the upstream remote):
`git diff upstream/master -u -- "*.py" | flake8 --diff`

or `make flake8-diff` which should work on unix-like systems.

5. Often pull requests resolve one or more other issues (or pull requests). If merging your pull request means that some other issues/PRs should be closed, you should [use keywords to create links to them](https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests/) (e.g., `Fixes #1234`; multiple issues/PRs are allowed as long as each one is preceded by a keyword). Upon merging, those issues/PRs will automatically be closed by GitHub. If your pull request is simply related to some other issues/PRs, create a link to them without using the keywords (e.g., `See also #1234`).

6. PRs should often substantiate the change, through benchmarks of performance and efficiency or through examples of usage. Examples also illustrate the features and intricacies of the library to users.

7. New features often need to be illustrated with narrative documentation in the user guide, with small code snippets. If relevant, please also add references in the literature, with PDF links when possible.

8. The user guide should also include expected time and space complexity of the algorithm and scalability, e.g. “this algorithm can scale to a large number of samples > 100000, but does not scale in dimensionality: n_features is expected to be lower than 100”.

9. Moderate use of type annotations is encouraged but is not mandatory. See [mypy quickstart](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html) for an introduction, as well as [pandas contributing documentation]( https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/development/contributing.html#type-hints) for style guidelines.
