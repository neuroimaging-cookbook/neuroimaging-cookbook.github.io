Or would you like to make it easier for someone (a non-techie, perhaps) in your team to make edits easily? If interested, follow along. Else, skip to the next section
Let's sync your site with forestry CMS.
Prerequisites !! Obviously you ought to have a github account. This is where your website source will live. Basically, forestry will read from github and write (commmit) to your github repo.</description></item><item><title>Overview</title><link>https://example.com/docs/compose/overview/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/docs/compose/overview/</guid><description>Instead of writing all your site pages from scratch, Hugo lets you define and use shortcodes.
Why shortcodes? While markdown is sufficient to produce simple pages, it's insufficient where complex page structures are needed. Thusly, whenever we need special styling, shortcodes compliment the shortcomings of markdown.
This way, you can side step complex html and css boilerplate in your content files.</description></item><item><title>Shortcodes</title><link>https://example.com/docs/compose/shortcodes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/docs/compose/shortcodes/</guid><description>Why shortcodes?

Sometimes, the shortcode will wrap content, sometimes it won't. When content is wrapped, a closing shortcode tag is needed. Please see the link I provided above and the markdown files for examples.</description></item><item><title>Shortcodes Applied</title><link>https://example.com/docs/compose/shortcodes-example/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/docs/compose/shortcodes-example/</guid><description>Using blocks, columns &amp;amp; buttons 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 {{&amp;lt; block &amp;#34;grid-2&amp;#34; &amp;gt;}} {{&amp;lt; column &amp;gt;}} #### Coumn 1 Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, ... {{&amp;lt; button &amp;#34;https://github.com/onweru/compose&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Download Theme&amp;#34; &amp;gt;}} {{&amp;lt; /column &amp;gt;}} {{&amp;lt; column &amp;gt;}} &amp;lt;!-- generates 👇 --&amp;gt; Coumn 1 Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et</description></item><item><title>Search</title><link>https://example.com/docs/compose/search/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/docs/compose/search/</guid><description>Compose implements fuse.js to enable search functionality. At the time of this writing, search on these theme takes either of this forms:
1. Passive search This occurs only when the user loads the search page i.e /search/. They can directly navigate to that url. Alternatively, the user can type you search query on the search field and click enter. They will be redirected to the search page which will contain matched results if any.</description></item></channel></rss>
